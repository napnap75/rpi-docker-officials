This is a clone of [the official OpenJDK images](https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/) for the raspberry pi.

The changes from the original images are :
- built from armhf/buildpack-deps instead of buildpack-deps and armhf/alpine instead of alpine

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/napnap75/rpi-docker-officials/tree/master/openjdk) and the image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/napnap75/rpi-openjdk-official/).

This image is build every week.
